    - Bugs:
        - empty keys
        - take numbers out of keyword
    - better performance
    - better entry points for index
    - better json response
    - similar words
    - when we run with gunicorn we will have to keep the copy of datastore per server
    - Parallel computation
    - Measure performance
    - web interface
    - mongo DB, scale
    - configure filter not
    - configure ignore files/dir
    - configure ignore prefix (home)
    - transactions
    - bson?
    - docker

    - Trie Journey:
    - First saved word in the leafs
    - Then retrieved the word by traversing the tree
    - Then saved only ord(character)
    - Then saved strings as bytes - it is taking too long to create the memory structures with encoding

    Weekend:
        - Maybe shoud run multiprocess with half cpus
        - Solve memory issue or hold it --> If can't really solve it, do it using mongo or sqlite
        - save trie and load trie?
        - add extension to key word
        - Need to break words with separators and index for sub words as well
        - create utility packages (logger)
        - create setup.py
        - enum for entities
